# Deep-Learning-Assignment
Implentation of Algorithm (Task 1:- Linear Regression, Task 2: Support Vector Machine,  Task 3: Decision Tree Classification) by using Google Colab

This repository contains the implementation of three machine learning algorithms as part of my coursework.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Decision Tree

## Project Structure

- notebooks/ → Contains all Google Colab notebooks
- README.md → Project description

## Tools Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Each notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

This project helped me understand practical implementation of regression and classification algorithms.
